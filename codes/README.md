Our project on adaptive voter model experienced many trials.
It can be summarized to 3 stages:
1. Political-opinion-voter-model.py: Simple voter model. The results always converge to
one state.
2. Political-majority-rule.py: Applied probabilistic majority decision for voter model. The
results were not improved.
3. Final-project-adptive-voter-model.py: Applied edge removal and weighted majority
decision with voter model. We achieved satisfied results.
